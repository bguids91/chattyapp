Chatty App
=====================

A real-time chat web application that is primarily a client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS. 
Contains a chat log displaying messages and notifications as well as an input field to change your name and an input field to send a message. The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates.
No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience.
